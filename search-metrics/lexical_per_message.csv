Azaz works early morning shifts at a coffee shop (leaves at 5am, back by 2pm), and Inzamim is a freelance designer who works from home but travels frequently for client meetings. I work a regular 9-5 office job.  We've been having some tension about cleaning - Azaz feels like they're always doing dishes since they're home in the afternoons, Inzamim says they shouldn't have to vacuum when they're barely home, and honestly I've been slacking on bathroom cleaning.
